### JavaScript

1. Hoisting => variables and functions are pushed(hoisetd) to the top of the scope
2. Prior to ES6, we used a design pattern called IIFE to create a block scope
3. With ES6 let and const is used to declare a block scope, with no hoisting.
4. global scope: There is a global object and all declaration(global) are members of this object.
5. global object: browser the global object is "window" and in Nodejs the global obect is called "global"
